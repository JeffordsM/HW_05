# HW_05

## Tecnologis Used
    The Main source I used for this page was Moment. I used several varietions of the moment format command to get the current date and hour.

## How It Works
    The rows are generated through Java scrpt using an array for the times. Using Moment I see if the current hour is bigger, smaller, or the same as each of the times in the array and that is how each row gets each of their colors.
